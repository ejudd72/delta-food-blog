# delta-food-blog
Team Delta's food blog project

## To clone repository
 on command line use git clone git@github.com:ejudd72/delta-food-blog 


## Dist and Src folders
You should only change what is in the src file, do not touch the dist folder. This contains files automatically compiled by our css watch and js files and is minified. 

Please note that the styles.css in the dist/css folder has been minified, it has been left as styles.css to make it easier when minifying html and not having to rename the CSS href attribute.
